# Text Processing and Analysis Tool

- Java | March 2024 | CUS 1151 â€“ Advanced Data Structures
- Developer: Aidin Dzaferovic

## ðŸ“Œ **Overview**

This project analyzes "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" using Java. It performs tokenization, removes stopwords, counts word frequencies, and calculates key dataset statistics such as total tokens, unique words, and punctuation marks. The program demonstrates efficient use of advanced data structures and algorithmic optimization.

## ðŸ’¡ **Key Features**

- **Tokenization & Stopword Removal**
  Processes large text datasets by filtering out common stopwords using a HashSet for O(1) lookups.

- **Word Frequency Analysis**
  Uses a HashMap to count word occurrences efficiently, displaying results in descending order.

- **Dataset Insights**
  Outputs the total number of tokens, unique words, stopwords, and punctuation marks.

- **Optimized Performance**
  Most operations run in O(n) or O(n log n) time, with preprocessing carefully designed to scale.

## ðŸ“Š **Output Snapshot**

- **Total Tokens:** 28,301

- **Unique Words:** 2,367

- **Stopwords Removed:** 17,780

- **Punctuation Marks:** 8,303

## ðŸ§° **Technologies & Concepts**

- Java (Eclipse IDE)

- HashMap and HashSet for fast data access

- File I/O

- Text parsing and data cleaning

- Algorithmic time complexity: O(n), O(n log n), O(nÂ²)
